Obsidian Google Calendar Sync - OAuth Scope Verification

This video demonstrates how the Obsidian Google Calendar Sync plugin uses Google Calendar API scopes to provide functionality. The plugin syncs tasks from Obsidian to Google Calendar, allowing users to see their tasks in their calendar.

The plugin requires the following OAuth scopes:
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar (to create and update calendar events)
- https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile (to identify the user's calendar)

In this demonstration, you can see:
1. How the authentication process works
2. How tasks are synced from Obsidian to Google Calendar
3. How the plugin handles data security and privacy
