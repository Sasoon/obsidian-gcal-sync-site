# Tips for a Successful Google Verification Video

## What Google Reviewers Are Looking For

Google reviewers need to verify that your application:

1. **Uses OAuth scopes appropriately**: Clearly demonstrate why each requested scope is necessary
2. **Handles user data responsibly**: Show how data is protected and not misused
3. **Functions as described**: Prove that your app does what you claim it does
4. **Has a legitimate use case**: Demonstrate the value to users

## Best Practices

### Be Clear and Concise
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use simple language to explain technical concepts
- Keep the video under 5 minutes if possible

### Show the Complete Flow
- Demonstrate the entire user journey from authentication to using the app
- Show both successful operations and how errors are handled
- Highlight security measures in place

### Focus on OAuth Scopes
- Explicitly mention each scope your app requests
- Show exactly how each scope is used in your application
- Explain why less permissive scopes wouldn't be sufficient

### Highlight Data Handling
- Show where user data is stored (locally in this case)
- Explain what happens to the data when the plugin is uninstalled
- Demonstrate that you're not collecting unnecessary information

### Visual Clarity
- Use a high-resolution screen recording (1080p minimum)
- Increase font sizes where possible for readability
- Consider adding text overlays to emphasize key points
- Blur or obscure any sensitive information

## Common Reasons for Rejection

- Not clearly demonstrating how each scope is used
- Requesting broader scopes than necessary for functionality
- Poor video quality making it difficult to assess the application
- Not showing the complete user flow
- Missing privacy policy or terms of service
- Collecting more user data than necessary

## Final Checklist Before Submission

- Video clearly shows all requested OAuth scopes in use
- Authentication flow is demonstrated completely
- Data storage and security measures are explained
- Privacy policy is referenced and accessible
- Video quality is high and text is readable
- No sensitive information is visible
